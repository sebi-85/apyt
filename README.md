# The APyT Package: From Raw Atom Probe Data to Three-Dimensional Reconstruction

The APyT package is an advanced, open-source Python framework for evaluating
atom probe tomography (APT) data. It offers a suite of modules that automate key
steps in APT processing, from mass spectrum calibration to three-dimensional
sample reconstruction. Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration
with external tools through standardized input/output interfaces, supporting
both Linux and Windows environments. Users can import and use each module
independently, or integrate them in custom workflows or GUI applications.

For ready-to-use scenarios or testing, a command line interface (CLI) is
provided. The CLI offers lightweight wrappers around the core modules, enabling
users to process raw measurement data without writing additional Python code. It
is particularly useful for exploratory analysis, quick prototyping, and
stand-alone usage.

Key features include high efficiency with [NumPy][numpy] and [Numba][numba], a
low memory footprint, and extensive documentation. The modules are highly
automated, requiring minimal user input to achieve accurate results. The package
also integrates SQL or local database management for raw measurement data and
corresponding metadata.
